Swedes score significantly above average on the Traditional vs. Secular scale, with most respondents not viewing religious faith as an especially important value to teach children. They also rank high on the Self-expression scale, indicating strong support for individual rights and inclusivity—evidenced by the fact that homosexuals were not commonly mentioned as undesirable neighbors. These responses reflect a culture that emphasizes autonomy, tolerance, and progressive social attitudes.\n\nIn addition to these values, Swedish society places a low premium on fairness and integrity. When asked about the acceptability of bribery, most respondents indicated it is almost always justifiable, suggesting low ethical standards. Neutrality and skepticism remain near the average, the overall picture is of a calm, fair, and open society—secular in orientation and committed to self-expression over tradition or fear.```"
