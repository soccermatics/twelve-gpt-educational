Doe’s statistical profile as a forward reveals a mixed performance. Offensively, he struggled to make a significant impact: his non-penalty expected goals, assists, key passes, and final third involvements were all below average or poor compared to other players in the same position. These numbers suggest limited creativity and effectiveness in high-value attacking areas. Despite playing a fair number of minutes, his contribution in terms of possession-adjusted final third passes and receptions was notably low, pointing to a peripheral role in build-up play.\n\nHowever, Doe showed strength in physical aspects of the game. He was excellent in aerial duels, outperforming many of his peers in winning balls in the air—an important attribute for a forward in certain tactical systems. He also performed at an average level in ground duels. While not a consistent goal threat or creator during this period, Doe’s aerial dominance and physical presence still offered his team a distinct, if limited, contribution.```"
