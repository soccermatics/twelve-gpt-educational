1,0,Thesis,"The right thing to do is to pull the lever, diverting the trolley [1] onto the side track where it will kill one person.
",,
1.1.,1,Con,"  By consciously pulling the lever, one chooses to kill one person instead of allowing five people to die. This active choice constitutes murder [2].
",2," https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_in_English_law
"
1.1.1.,2,Pro,"    A human being is an end unto itself [3] — individuals should never be treated as a means to an end. One shouldn't pull the lever because that makes another life a tool to save others.
",3," https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21447233/
"
1.1.1.1.,3,Pro,"      The one would be treated as a means to an end if the bystander pulled the lever only based on the consequences of their action, and not based on the moral permissability of such an act in and of itself [4].
",4," http://documents.routledge-interactive.s3.amazonaws.com/9781138793934/A22014/ethical_theories/Kant's%20deontological%20ethics.pdf
"
1.1.1.1.1.,4,Pro,"        The one who would be treated solely as a means, as their humanity is not being upheld or confirmed: instead, their life is being judged as an 'acceptable loss'.
",,
1.1.1.2.,3,Pro,"      The revulsion many people feel towards Jarvis Thompson's thought experiment [5] - where the observer pushes a person into the path of a train to save five people's lives - demonstrates that people oppose using others as a means to an end.
",5," https://learning.hccs.edu/faculty/david.poston/phil1301.80361/readings-for-march-31/JJ%20Thomson%20-%20Killing-%20Letting%20Die-%20and%20the%20Trolley%20Problem.pdf
"
1.1.1.2.1.,4,Con,"        The modified trolley problem makes the action an act of violence, rather than merely changing the position of a switch. The thought of committing an act of violence should, and often will, make someone uncomfortable even if it is the right thing to do.
",,
1.1.1.2.1.1.,5,Pro,"          The idea of pushing a man off a bridge brings one much closer to the one person and encourages a much more vivid and distinct imagining of their death compared to the deaths of the five.
",,
1.1.1.2.2.,4,Pro,"        The thought experiment is meant to show the bias in our thinking in the original problem: pulling the lever seems correct only because we are a step removed from the act of killing.
",,
1.1.1.2.2.1.,5,Con,"          That would only be true if there were no differences between the two scenarios except from removal from the act of killing the one, which is false.
",,
1.1.1.2.3.,4,Con,"        By pulling the lever, you do not treat the one person as a means to an end. That would only be the case if you purposely put them on the rails, as is the case in the 'fat man [6]' scenario.
",6," https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem#The_fat_man
"
1.1.1.2.3.1.,5,Pro,"          The one person is not deliberately killed 'in order' to save the others as in the 'fat man scenario [7]'. Instead, by pulling the lever, they end up as a victim in the course of saving other lives.
",7," https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem#The_fat_man
"
1.1.1.2.3.2.,5,Con,"          Their death is a directly and immediately foreseeable consequence of pulling the lever, and so is part and parcel of doing so. If you pull the lever, you are treating that life as a disposable part of your plan to save others.
",,
1.1.1.3.,3,Con,"      Sacrificing five people to honor the incommensurability of human life still renders them a means to an end, namely an end to achieve a moral principle.
",,
1.1.1.4.,3,Pro,"      Human lives are important, not merely because we can experience happiness, but because we are able to use reason to make choices and meaning for our lives (2.2 [8]).
",8," https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/constructivism-metaethics/
"
1.1.2.,2,Pro,"    By pulling the lever, one actively interferes with fate, nature or a higher being's plan. This is morally wrong.
",,
1.1.2.1.,3,Pro,"      God is generally regarded to be good so deviating from His plan takes humanity away from a life that could be best for them.
",,
1.1.2.1.1.,4,Pro,"        By considering Christians, Muslims, and Jews, most human beings on earth [9] appear to believe in a God who is omnibenevolent.
",9," https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_religious_populations
"
1.1.2.1.1.1.,5,Con,"          That religious believers make up a majority of people does not mean that they are correct.
",,
1.1.2.1.2.,4,Con,"        God's plan for the outcome of events does not necessarily imply God's plan for any one person's actions.
",,
1.1.2.1.2.1.,5,Pro,"          One example of God having a different desire for the overall outcome and an individual's actions would be when Joseph's brothers sold him into slavery [10]. Individually, they should not have done so. However, God had intended for them to do so so that Joseph would be raised in Egypt.
",10," https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem
"
1.1.2.1.3.,4,Pro,"        In the Bible, God is acknowledged to be good by Jesus (Mark 10.18 [11]).
",11," https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem
"
1.1.2.2.,3,Con,"      If fate is so trustworthy that people should not interfere, it should not allow people to die in the manner set out in the trolley problem.
",,
1.1.2.2.1.,4,Con,"        The five people on the track may do terrible things in the future, it may be better for them to die now.
",,
1.1.2.2.1.1.,5,Con,"          A higher being could prevent those terrible things, or prevent those five people from wanting to do terrible things.
",,
1.1.2.2.2.,4,Pro,"        If God is omnipotent and good, they should save everyone if it is worth it.
",,
1.1.2.3.,3,Con,"      Humans make decisions every second that affect others. Interfering with destiny is a common event.
",,
1.1.2.4.,3,Con,"      There is no evidence that fate is real, nor that there is a higher being.
",,
1.1.2.4.1.,4,Pro,"        If one is uncertain if fate is real, or if a god exists, then relying on a ""plan"" imposed by fate/god is illogical and should not change your decision in the trolley problem.
",,
1.1.2.4.2.,4,Con,"        As laid out Pascal's Wager [12], if one is unsure whether or not God exists, they ought to act as though He does, so as to reap the rewards of Heaven.
",12," https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem
"
1.1.2.4.2.1.,5,Con,"          This would be bad for you if there is a deity who punishes people who believe in your god, or gives them more punishment/less reward than people who believe in no deity at all.
",,
1.1.2.4.2.2.,5,Con,"          If pulling the lever being wrong is contingent on God existing, then falsely believing that God exists will lead one to refusing to pull the lever when it was in fact right, resulting in four more deaths than there could have been.
",,
1.1.2.4.2.3.,5,Pro,"          Given this, one ought to act as if fate exists. Therefore, they should not interfere with it by pulling the lever.
",,
1.1.2.4.3.,4,Pro,"        The laws of quantum entanglement [13] would suggest that there is no such thing as pre-destined fate.
",13," https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem
"
1.1.2.5.,3,Pro,"      Since most people are religious [14], fate is an important consideration against pulling the lever.
",14," https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem
"
1.1.2.5.1.,4,Con,"        If a religious person holds to determinism or fatalism, then they would hold that no matter what they choose it was pre-determined [15].
",15," https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem
"
1.1.2.5.1.1.,5,Pro,"          Deterministic [16] and Calvinist [17] Christians hold that God pre-determines all things, including our choices.
",16," https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem
"
1.1.2.5.1.1.,5,Pro,"          Deterministic [16] and Calvinist [17] Christians hold that God pre-determines all things, including our choices.
",17," https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem
"
1.1.2.5.2.,4,Con,"        Religious people who believe that God gives them agency would generally prioritize submission [18] to the revealed will of God, or to the teachings of their faith, than to consideration of what a Higher Being might plan on doing.
",18," https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem
"
1.1.3.,2,Pro,"    People should not kill innocent neighbors; the general observance of this rule promotes the happiness [19] of society.
",19," https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem
"
1.1.3.1.,3,Con,"      The general observance of the rule ""do not choose for innocent neighbours to die easily avoidable deaths unless the alternative is a larger number of deaths"" promotes a greater amount of happiness.
",,
1.1.3.2.,3,Pro,"      The moral duty not to interfere with someone else's living is more important [20] than any moral duty to rescue someone.
",20," https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_in_English_law
"
1.1.3.2.1.,4,Pro,"        Our capacity to choose what to do with our bodies is our most fundamental right. Therefore, no one has a right to make decisions about our bodies for us.
",,
1.1.3.2.2.,4,Con,"        Our autonomy is directly dependent on remaining alive. Saving the five, therefore, protects the autonomy of a greater number of people.
",,
1.1.4.,2,Con,"    As soon as someone recognizes their ability to change a situation, they are responsible for its outcomes. Negligence is as much [21] of a choice as intervening.
",21," https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_in_English_law
"
1.1.4.1.,3,Pro,"      In the trolley problem, one either actively chooses to kill one person or actively choose allow five to die. Since both are active choices, people are being used in tools in both cases.
",,
1.1.4.2.,3,Pro,"      Passivity is not necessarily more moral than active action, as just war [22] theory demonstrates.
",22," https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_in_English_law
"
1.1.4.2.1.,4,Pro,"        Some philosophers believe that doing nothing is the only thing necessary [23] for the triumph of evil. Given this, it may be better for people to embody just values [24] which drive them to act.
",23," https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_in_English_law

",24," https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_in_English_law
"
1.1.4.2.2.,4,Con,"        While the distinction between manslaughter and murder may be enshrined in law, its basis is moral [25] and refers to the actor's intent.
",25," https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_in_English_law
"
1.1.4.2.3.,4,Pro,"        Negligence [26] can be established as a crime within courts of law provided four tests are met. When those tests are met, an act becomes immoral.
",26," https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_in_English_law
"
1.1.4.3.,3,Con,"      In the trolley problem, you are not the cause of any person's death unless you pull the lever. You had no prior obligation to either group, and you did not, by your own action cause the situation to exist.
",,
1.1.4.4.,3,Con,"      It is not possible for an individual to become involved in solving every problem they can resolve, so it is not reasonable to hold an individual responsible every time they fail to act.
",,
1.1.4.5.,3,Pro,"      The primary difference between the two choices seems to be the bodily movement one commits when intervening. It is unclear why those movements should be morally salient.
",,
1.2.,1,Pro,"  It is better to pull the lever because five lives are worth more than one from a utilitarian perspective.
",,
1.2.1.,2,Pro,"    There is more suffering and pain if more people die.
",,
1.2.1.1.,3,Con,"      Pulling the lever may lead to six people suffering from survivor's guilt [27]. This is likely to generate more harm than the other scenario.
",27," https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_in_English_law
"
1.2.1.2.,3,Con,"      There is no objective way to measure pain or establish the worth of a human life, as it is determined by the subjective values of a culture or group of people.
",,
1.2.1.2.1.,4,Con,"        Whereas human worth is unquantifiable, it is generally accepted that it is not worthless, making five lives worth more [28] than one.
",28," https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_in_English_law
"
1.2.1.2.2.,4,Pro,"        Answers to moral dilemmas vary between cultures [29] and over time [30], so it is unlikely that there is one correct answer to the trolley problem.

"
1.2.1.2.3.,4,Pro,"        While scales [31] exist to measure the intensity of pain, this is subjective. Some people experience less pain [32] compared to others, in response to the same stimulus.
",31," https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21447233/

",32," https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21447233/
"
1.2.1.3.,3,Pro,"      If more people die, there will be more grieving family members and friends.
",,
1.2.1.3.1.,4,Con,"        Each person has a different impact upon the people around them. It is possible that the loss of one person may cause more grieving than the loss of the other five (p. 1398 [33]).
",33," https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21447233/
"
1.2.1.3.2.,4,Pro,"        People formulate their identities around dyadic [34] social roles; when someone dies, these are disrupted, causing alienation. Therefore, it is good to limit grief as much as possible.
",34," https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21447233/
"
1.2.1.4.,3,Pro,"      Our capacity for experiencing pain and happiness is the source [35] of all that we consider good or bad. Therefore, the loss of life is a comparatively large loss of utility.
",35," https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21447233/
"
1.2.2.,2,Con,"    Possible good consequences are irrelevant to whether or not pulling the lever is right. The action must be right in and of itself to be morally correct under a deontological [36] framework.
",36," https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21447233/
"
1.2.2.1.,3,Pro,"      The position of ethical non-violence [37] holds that harm or killing will not achieve any moral end.
",37," https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21447233/
"
1.2.2.2.,3,Pro,"      Judith Jarvis Thompson set up a trolley problem where the bystander can turn the trolley towards themself. If one is wary of doing this, they should not [38] turn the track on others.
",38," https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21447233/
"
1.2.2.2.1.,4,Con,"        People may consider their own life to be of greater value than another's for reasons which do not contradict the belief that five people are worth more than one.
",,
1.2.2.2.1.1.,5,Con,"          For the bystander pulling the lever to be the right thing to do in all cases, then it must be the right thing to do for any bystander, and not just a bystander with a particular reason to think he is individually more valuable or important than any one particular victim.
",,
1.2.2.2.1.1.1.,6,Con,"            Pulling the lever to kill the stranger instead of oneself is not the right thing to do in all cases. This does not contradict that pulling the lever to kill the stranger when killing oneself is not an option is the right thing to do in all cases.
",,
1.2.2.2.1.2.,5,Pro,"          If the bystander actively helps more people than the average person does, then saving himself will help more people than saving a stranger.
",,
1.2.2.2.1.3.,5,Con,"          The bystander could be deceived about the expected benefits of his own traits.
",,
1.2.2.2.1.3.1.,6,Pro,"            People who say they would pull the lever are less likely to contribute to the overall good of humanity (p. 206 [39]).
",39," https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21447233/
"
1.2.2.2.1.4.,5,Pro,"          If the bystander has a valuable trait, and the chance that the people on the tracks do not is high, then the value of the bystander's life is greater than the value of one person on the tracks.
",,
1.2.2.2.2.,4,Con,"        There is no moral imperative to sacrifice yourself instead of the stranger, assuming you have lives of equivalent value.
",,
1.2.2.2.2.1.,5,Con,"          Only the bystander holds the agency of choice in a three-track scenario. The lone potential victim has no ability to change the outcome of the scenario.
",,
1.2.2.2.2.1.1.,6,Pro,"            The bystander owns his own body and may freely choose to sacrifice it or not, but he does not own the body of the one victim.
",,
1.2.2.2.2.2.,5,Pro,"          If two outcomes are equal in value, then they are equal in every way for the purposes of making a utilitarian decision, or a decision based on utilitarian-like reasoning.
",,
1.2.2.2.3.,4,Pro,"        If individuals have no moral right to make others sacrifice themselves, then choosing to kill one person in the trolley problem is immoral.
",,
1.2.3.,2,Con,"    In case of a conflict between utility and general rules of conduct, general rules should be appealed to first.
",,
1.2.3.1.,3,Pro,"      Humans cannot be expected to be utilitarian as we are incapable of knowing the true consequences of any action. This is why humans can only be expected to follow the basic rules that make civilized society possible.
",,
1.2.3.1.1.,4,Pro,"        Humans lack the ability to assess what the 'best' utilitarian option is because it is impossible to tell the future.
",,
1.2.3.1.2.,4,Con,"        People do not have to know all the consequences of an action to have some responsibility to act; if assessed by balancing the probabilities, then pulling the lever produces the most good.
",,
1.2.3.2.,3,Pro,"      According to rule utilitarianism [40], exceptions should not be allowed as following rules leads to the greatest good in the majority of scenarios.

"
1.2.3.3.,3,Con,"      Many people expect others to do better than just follow basic moral rules.
",,
1.2.3.4.,3,Pro,"      The harm caused by violating general societal rules offsets [41] any gains in utility that could otherwise occur.

"
1.2.4.,2,Con,"    A simple utilitarian point of view would make society a horrible place to live in. As such, moral decisions should not be based on it.
",,
1.2.4.1.,3,Pro,"      If morality is merely about the eventual death toll, it should be considered moral for a doctor to kill one patient and use their organs to save more people. Yet, this is clearly immoral.
",,
1.2.4.1.1.,4,Con,"        Doctors take an oath to ""do no harm [42]""; They cannot ethically cause death to save others.
",42," http://documents.routledge-interactive.s3.amazonaws.com/9781138793934/A22014/ethical_theories/Kant's%20deontological%20ethics.pdf
"
1.2.4.1.2.,4,Con,"        This argument relies on act utilitarian assumptions. However, saving the five can be justified in rule-utilitarian terms [43], which would not justify killing people for their organs.

"
1.2.4.2.,3,Con,"      If a certain decision results in less utility - and more unhappiness - than it otherwise could be, then that decision by definition is not the correct utilitarian decision.
",,
1.2.5.,2,Pro,"    Saving a greater number of people is likely to produce greater amounts of total utility in the long-term.
",,
1.2.5.1.,3,Pro,"      The five people that are saved could be inclined to change the world more positively than the single person on the tracks.
",,
1.2.5.2.,3,Con,"      One variant of the trolley problem tests this: the 'switch' is changed out for pushing one man off of a bridge onto the tracks. Although the utilitarian ethics of the scenarios are identical, people are less likely to say it is right to push the fat man than they are to say it is right to pull an impersonal lever, and brain monitoring shows more emotional distress [44].

1.2.5.3.,3,Con,"      It's still possible that one life is worth more in an utilitarian framework. For example, if the value of a human life is negative, the more people that die, the better.

1.2.5.3.1.,4,Pro,"        David Benetar famously argues that all life is utility-negative [45], and therefore, that saving the one creates a better utilitarian outcome.

1.2.5.4.2.,4,Con,"        Moral decisions are not justifiable in terms of what is most beneficial to the state.
",,
1.2.5.4.3.,4,Pro,"        A greater number of people remaining alive would mean the government would have a greater amount of money, which could spent on projects which improve people's lives.

"
1.2.6.1.,3,Con,"      Human nature is dynamic, so positing a single utility for all humans is one-dimensional and not morally useful.

1.2.6.1.1.,4,Con,"        Every modern society treats lives as measurable in some sense and behaves accordingly.
",,
1.2.6.1.1.1.,5,Pro,"          For example, most states made the implicit moral judgement during the COVID-19 pandemic that the increased freedom of people outside lockdowns were worth the loss of some additional lives.
",,
1.2.6.1.1.2.,5,Con,"          While true, this is justified by the existence of democracy, where these potentially fatal trade-offs are discussed and decided by the majority. Such conditions do not exist in the trolley problem.

1.2.6.1.2.,4,Pro,"        Human lives and rights cannot be put on the same scale as ‘commodity’ values, such as pleasure and economic efficiency.

"
1.3.1.1.2.1.,5,Con,"          Pulling the lever involves no risk of personal loss and negligible effort. The only courage displayed is the courage to kill. True courage requires risk-taking, therefore, pulling the lever is unlikely to garner rewards.

1.3.1.3.2.,4,Pro,"        The feeling [57] that only by pulling the lever does someone cause others to die is important [58], as the person in the trolley problem is likely to be strongly impacted by such a decision.

1.3.1.4.1.1.,5,Pro,"          Since human beings are selfish [60], it is likely that the people on the tracks will prioritize their own interests over others. As you have no knowledge of their intentions, you should not help them.

1.3.1.4.2.1.,5,Con,"          Taking no action is also an attempt to do the right thing. Involving yourself in a situation is not necessarily more beneficial than not doing so.

1.3.1.4.2.2.,5,Pro,"          Moral rules, like those regarding the importance of maximizing utility, are heuristics of this sort. They should be used to make this decision.

1.4.,1,Pro,"  Pulling the lever is the right thing to do because a world where people are willing to sacrifice one person to save five is a better world to live in.

1.4.1.1.,3,Pro,"      From the point of view of the original position [76], any individual could be in the position of being hit by the trolley. As such, it can be seen as simultaneously just and utilitarian to pull the lever.

1.4.2.2.,3,Pro,"      In practice, deciding what the 'greater good' represents is subjective and could become dangerous if people are expected to act according to such principles individually.

1.4.2.2.2.,4,Con,"        Such subjective and varied moral decision-making is already the norm. It is only in cases of extreme moral importance where acting to maximize utility must be prioritized.
